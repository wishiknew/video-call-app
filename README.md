Hi,

The task is to build video call app built using:
- https://docs.holepunch.to
- https://www.electronjs.org

Features:
- Share key for others to connect to you
- Connect to other users using key
- Save them as contact using key and a name (opt)
- In the chat
  - Send pictures (opt)
  - Sent text messages (opt)
  - Audio + Video call over holepunch (not webrtc stun/turn, etc.)

Bare minimum UI, features. Just need a PoC

Do this on a private repo in Github and share with https://github.com/subashsn
